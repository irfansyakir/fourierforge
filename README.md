Title: Development of flutter apps for Fourier series

Summary:	This project aims to develop flutter apps running on smart devices for Fourier series. The project involves flutter programming and testing using simulator on PC and/or on ipad/Android phone. Step-by-step workings should be shown to help clarify the solutions of exam questions. Animations of relevant equations or illustrative graphics would be useful whenever possible.

A mobile application developed for solving Fourier series exam questions, providing step-by-step solutions. The app incorporates UI/UX design principles and color theory to create an intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Wave Visualization**: Interactive visualization of waveforms (square, sawtooth, triangle) with adjustable parameters
- **Problem Solver**: Step-by-step solutions for rectifier circuits and equation problems
- **Sample Solutions**: Worked examples from past exam questions
- **Cheat Sheet**: Quick reference for Fourier series formulas and concepts

## Technologies Used

- Flutter
- Dart
- Mathematics Libraries (flutter_math_fork, fl_chart)

## Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to start the app in debug mode

## Web Deployment

This app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. To deploy:

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings > Pages)
3. The GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy the web version

## Manual Web Deployment

To manually build for web:

```bash
# From the project directory
flutter build web --release --base-href /fourierforge/
```
